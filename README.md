# final_emotional_project
In this project we have tried to predict human emotions based on their images. We have a dataset of approx 30000 images which we have trained using our designed cnn model to predict human emotions .Any kind of progress and suggestions are highly welcomed. 

The emotion_detection google colab file contains the source code for the cnn model in which we have tried three approaches towards emotion detection owing to which we have picked the best approach.
The flask_site file contains the source code from which we have created the software for our model.

The index.html and ack.html are the respective html files for the softare.

The archive.zip contains the dataset used( contains both train and test dataset)
